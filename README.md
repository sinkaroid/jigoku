## The Problem

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1046495201176334467/1049067378224410785/Screenshot_70.png" width="800" alt="jigoku">

Hell opening fuckton of tabs, and download them one by one. Piece of crap  
Welp, It's not tough actually if still same website, there is also tampermonkey hacks to mock them, but what if you want to get 'em from multiple websites?


## The Solution

No more tampermonkey hacks, no more opening a fuckton of tabs, no more spliting your note between r34, gelbooru, e621 or anything else. Just one command through single file, this tools will adapt.

It's fairly simple to use jigoku

`pip install jigoku`

- Or manual build by cloning this repository and run `python setup.py install`


## Usage
Just run without any arguments and interactive prompt will get you,  

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1046495201176334467/1049111079562784778/17_1.png" width="600" alt="jigoku">  

`$ jigoku`

1. First prompt will ask you to input your file
    - Input your file.txt

2. Second prompt will ask you what kind of links you have
    - `(1)` multiple posts or galleries 
    - `(2)` multiple pages

3. Third prompt will ask you for image resolution
    - `(1)` original, means the original, big size
    - `(2)` sample, means smaller than original

## Running tests
Is current state not covers enough? Feel free to add more test cases and submit a pull request.  

> Multiple posts test: [workflows/jigoku_posts.yml](https://github.com/sinkaroid/jigoku/actions/workflows/jigoku_posts.yml)  
Multiple pages test: [workflows/jigoku_pages.yml](https://github.com/sinkaroid/jigoku/actions/workflows/jigoku_pages.yml)  
Example file input: [jigoku/tree/master/test](https://github.com/sinkaroid/jigoku/tree/master/test)


### Phrases
This pattern used for validating **posts** or **galleries**  

> `/posts/` danbooru based, `&id=` gelbooru based, `?id=` gelbooru based, `/show` yandere based, `/post/view/` paheal based 

Otherwise, it will assign to **pages**

For example, If you confused between `(1)` and `(2)`, check this out:

- `https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/5874589`
- `https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&s=view&id=7004047`
    - This is post, choose `(1)`
- `https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=1girl&z=1`
- `https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&s=list&tags=1girl`
    - This is pages, choose `(2)`
- `https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=kiryuuin_satsuki+&z=5`
- `https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&s=list&tags=kiryuuin_satsuki`
    - This is pages from tags, choose `(2)`
- `https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?page=2&tags=kiryuuin_satsuki+`
- `https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&s=list&tags=kiryuuin_satsuki&pid=42`
    - This is pages from tags with page number, choose `(2)`
- `https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=hews+&z=5`
- `https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&s=list&tags=belko`
    - This is pages from artist, choose `(2)`

## Limitations
You may notice that some part were strictly to "Original" resolution and "Sample" is no use, I'm pretty sure there are some limitations, for example old posts perhaps has different structures, but I haven't found any yet, current test cases has over 1000+ posts and took 20+ minutes, and it works fine.
